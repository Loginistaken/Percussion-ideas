Geometry & thickness profile (designed for the same mellow jazz character) 

Design goal: keep the same warm, mellow crash timbre while scaling dimensions to 16". 

That means slightly more body, slightly slower bloom, and the same relative taper. 

Outer diameter: 406.4 mm (16″) Center hole: 8.3 mm (standard) Bell radius (from center): 28.6 mm (scaled from 25 mm at 14") 

Thickness profile (radial samples, mm): — thicker bell for articulation, gentle taper to thin edge for fast mellow crash r ≈ 4.15 mm (just 

outside hole) — 2.30 mm r ≈ 12 mm — 2.40 mm r ≈ 28.6 mm (bell edge) — 2.60 mm 

(slightly thicker bell than 14" to keep defined ping) r ≈ 60 mm — 2.40 mm r ≈ 120 mm — 2.00 mm r ≈ 180 mm — 1.40 mm r ≈ 203.2 mm (outer edge) — 

1.00 mm Reason: the larger diameter increases radiating area and low-end

content; slightly thicker bell + slightly thicker mid-bow keep the same 

perceived “ping” and prevent the larger disc from becoming flabby.

The thin edge (1.0 mm) preserves quick response and a mellow crash bloom. 

Mass & volume (how I scaled it) The 16″ cymbal area scales as

(16/14)² ≈ 1.306 times the 14″ disc. Using the previous 14″ mass ≈ 820 g, the 16″

mass estimate = 820 g × 1.306 ≈ 1,071 g (rounded ~1.07 kg). This mass is used to compute material masses below. 

Per-material masses (grams) (Composition = 25% Al₂O₃ | 35% Ti | 30% Fe | 10% Au) Al₂O₃: ≈ 268 g Titanium: ≈ 375 g Iron (Fe / ferrous): ≈ 321 g 

Gold (Au): ≈ 107 g Price assumptions & sources (short) I used up-to-date spot/industry indexes (Oct 2025 snapshots) for pricing: Gold spot:

Per-material raw costs (calculation) Using the masses above and the price assumptions: Al₂O₃: 268 g × US$0.000339/g ≈ US$0.09 Titanium: 375 g × US$0.0100/g ≈ US$3.75 Iron: 321 g × US$0.000427/g ≈ US$0.14 Gold: 107.1 g × US$136.64/g ≈ US$14,634.28 Total raw material cost ≈ US$14,638. (Gold dominates the cost). Gold Price +2 Carbon Credits +2 Small parts & inserts Al₂O₃ threaded sleeve (ceramic-loaded polymer or small ceramic ring): volume ≈ 0.6 cm³ → mass ≈ ~2.5 g Al₂O₃ equivalent (negligible cost at alumina prices). For practical durability use a ceramic-filled high-performance polymer for threads (less brittle). Silicone protective washer (replace felt): suggested geometry: outer Ø 20 mm, inner Ø 9 mm, thickness 4 mm, durometer 30–40A (soft). Mass ≈ ~1–2 g; material cost negligible (~cents). Manufacturing & finishing (estimates) MMC production (powder metallurgy / hot pressing / HIP or infiltration casting): specialized — expect US$600 – $2,000 for a one-off prototype depending on facility and process (gold handling, powder processing, HIP time). Machining / lathe / hand-hammer tuning / lathing / finish: another US$200 – $1,000 depending on hand tuning level and artisan work. Secure handling / insurance (gold content), shipping, QC: variable but add a small premium. Estimated manufacturing + finishing for single prototype: US$900 – $2,000 (use high end for facilities that will handle gold and MMC reliably).

Estimated final one-off build (materials + processing + finishing): ≈ US$15,500 – US$18,000. Acoustic rationale (why these choices keep the “same” sound) Larger diameter adds more low-mid body — to keep the same perceived jazz warmth we increased bell thickness slightly (2.60 mm) so articulation remains present. Edge thinness (1.0 mm) preserves quick response and avoids long, loud wash — that keeps it suitable for jazz combo contexts. 

Al₂O₃ at 25% continues to add micro-damping and reduces brittle shimmer — crucial to a mellow tone. Ti (35%) preserves a lively attack and clarity for stick definition. Fe (30%) provides body and low-mid weight. Au (10%) increases density/damping and subtle harmonic rounding — audibly warm but extremely costly. Mechanical mounting details (updated for 16") Use the same M8-style sleeve strategy. 
For 16″ the bell boss area can be slightly deeper (countersink depth +1 mm) to better support the slightly larger bell stresses. 
The Al₂O₃-filled polymer sleeve is still recommended for thread longevity. Silicone washer specs the same: 30–40A durometer, 4 mm thick. Replace felt with this for better protection and consistent damping.
