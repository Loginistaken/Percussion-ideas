5A stick so the final playable mass (≈42 g / stick) includes the 6″ silicone hand sleeve and the new thin TPU tip cap (0.5 mm strike face). 

Hollow-tube geometry needed for the MMC alloy (Al₂O₃ 25% | Ti 35% | Fe 30% | Au 10%), recalc masses, costs for a pair,

durability, and tuning. 


5.43 g/cm³, gold price ≈ US$136.64 / g, and typical commodity prices for Ti/Fe/Al₂O₃

(these mainly affect tiny costs here — gold dominates).

Summary (one line)

A hollow MMC 5A stick, OD ≈ 14.0 mm, length 406 mm, designed so total mass ≈ 42 g per stick

including: 6″ silicone grip sleeve (removable) and a TPU strike cap (≈0.5 mm at face, Shore A 80). 

Pair raw materials ≈ US$675; prototype pair total ≈ US$925 – $1,325.

Target masses & what’s included

Target per-stick gross mass (final, playable): 42.0 g

Included subcomponents per stick:

MMC structural shell (the metal/ceramic alloy): ≈ 24.7 g

Silicone hand sleeve (6 in / 152.4 mm): ≈ 15.8 g (removable)

TPU tip cap (thin 0.5 mm strike face + thin skirt): ≈ 1.5 g

adhesive/overlap etc: ≈ 0–0.2 g (small)

Per-pair total mass: ≈ 84.0 g (2 × 42 g)

Note: I tuned the MMC structural mass down from earlier (42 g raw stick) so the final assembled stick stays at the 5A feel 

while including the heavier silicone sleeve.

Geometry & hollowing calculation (how we get the 24.7 g MMC per stick)

Stick length L = 406 mm = 40.6 cm

Outer diameter D_out = 14.0 mm (R_out = 7.0 mm) — typical 5A feel.

Required MMC structural mass (per stick) = 42.0 g − (silicone sleeve 15.8 g) − (TPU tip 1.5 g) = ≈ 24.7 g.

Volume required of MMC: V = m / ρ = 24.7 g / 5.43 g/cm³ ≈ 4.55 cm³.

Cross-sectional area A = V / L = 4.55 cm³ / 40.6 cm ≈ 0.1121 cm² = 11.21 mm².

For outer radius R_out = 7 mm (R_out² = 49 mm²), inner radius R_in from A = π(R_out² − R_in²):
R_in² = R_out² − (A/π) = 49 − (11.21/3.1416) ≈ 45.434 → R_in ≈ 6.74 mm.

Wall thickness ≈ R_out − R_in ≈ 0.26 mm (average).

Practical note on wall thickness

0.26 mm average wall is very thin but achievable with careful MMC production (cold-spray/mandrel + HIP or thin tube consolidation).

It means the MMC is essentially a thin-walled tube with robust outer surface. 

If you prefer more mechanical robustness, increase wall to ~0.5–1.0 mm and reduce silicone sleeve mass 

(use a lighter sleeve material or shorter sleeve) or accept a slightly higher total stick mass (e.g., 46–48 g). 

Composition & per-pair material masses (MMC portion only)

MMC mass per stick (structural) ≈ 24.7 g → per pair structural mass ≈ 49.4 g.

Breakdown (mass %, MMC = Al₂O₃ 25% | Ti 35% | Fe 30% | Au 10%):

Gold (Au): 10% × 49.4 g ≈ 4.94 g (per pair)

Titanium (Ti): 35% × 49.4 g ≈ 17.29 g

Iron (Fe): 30% × 49.4 g ≈ 14.82 g

Al₂O₃: 25% × 49.4 g ≈ 12.35 g

TPU tip & silicone grip specs (materials & masses)

TPU tip cap: Shore A 80 (target), thickness at strike face 0.5 mm, skirt/seat for bonding, mass ≈ 1.5 g / stick. 

TPU density assumed ~1.15 g/cm³.

Silicone grip sleeve: length 152.4 mm (6"), wall geometry sized to fit OD 14 mm (inner dia ~13 mm),

durometer 30–40A, mass ≈ 15.8 g / sleeve (removable).

Tip and sleeve combined per stick ≈ 17.3 g.

Per-pair raw material cost (quick math)

Using prior gold price assumption US$136.64 / g:

Au (4.94 g) × $136.64/g ≈ US$674.6

Ti (~17.3 g) × $0.01/g ≈ US$0.17

Fe (~14.8 g) × $0.000427/g ≈ US$0.006

Al₂O₃ (~12.35 g) × $0.000339/g ≈ US$0.004

TPU tips + silicone sleeves (≈ 35–36 g total pair) × $0.005/g ≈ US$0.18

Raw materials total ≈ US$675 (rounded; gold dominates).

Manufacturing & finishing cost (per pair estimate)

Fabrication of hollow MMC tubes (cold spray / seamless mandrel + HIP / sinter & bore extraction) + CNC turning, 

tip-profile, cleaning & surface finish — US$200 – $450 (shop dependent).

Overmolding / co-molding TPU tip and silicone grip / bonding & final balance & QC — US$50 – $200.

Handling & small premiums for precious-metal content (security/insure) add a bit.

Estimated manufacturing & finishing for a prototype pair: ≈ US$250 – $650.

Estimated retail/prototype pair total (one-off)

Raw materials ≈ US$675

Manufacturing & finishing ≈ US$250 – $650

Total ≈ US$925 – $1,325 (single custom pair, prototype small batch).

If you reduce Au to 1% the raw material cost drops dramatically (I can recalc if you want).

Fabrication workflow (step-by-step) — what to hand to a prototyping shop

Mandrel / tube formation: produce a near-net seamless hollow MMC tube (length ≈ 420 mm to allow stock for turning).

Methods: cold-spray onto removable mandrel + consolidate/HIP, or powder-sleeve sinter around a soluble core. 

Ensure tight control of Al₂O₃ dispersion.

CNC rough turning: turn OD to 14.0 mm and machine tip geometry (acorn or barrel). 

Maintain wall thickness target ≈ 0.26 mm average; inspect for porosity.

Balance & tapering: machine and remove small amounts to match desired 5A taper and balance. 

Final mass target per stick before grips ≈ 24.7 g ± 0.5 g.

Surface finish / lathing: optional very light lathe finish or satin polish for desired look and small acoustic adjustments.

Surface prep for overmold: laser micro-texturing or bead blasting of tip region and grip region to create mechanical bond for overmold. 

Clean and prime per TPU & silicone bonding spec.

TPU tip overmold: co-mold TPU tip (Shore A 80, 0.5 mm strike face). Use micro-undercut features so cap mechanically locks to MMC tip. 

Alternatively: adhesive + clamp cure.

Silicone grip overmold or sleeve: either co-mold silicone grip onto barrel (preferred) or use removable molded sleeve sized to slip on. 

If removable, provide matching bore tolerances.

QA & testing: static/dynamic balance test; mass and length tolerance; 1,000 moderate strike test on sample cymbal to check wear, no marking; inspect cap adhesion.

Packaging & documentation: include cap replacement instructions; supply torque/strike warnings for heavy hitting.
